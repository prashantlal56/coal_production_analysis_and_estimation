# The U.S. Energy Information Administrationâ€™s (EIA) Form EIA-7A, Annual Survey of Coal Production and Preparation, collects coal
production data from U.S. coal mining companies. This includes information on the type and status of coal operations, characteristics of
coalbeds mined, recoverable reserves, productive capacity and the disposition of coal mined which provides Congress with basic
statistics concerning coal supply. These data appear in the Annual Coal Report, the Quarterly Coal Report, the Monthly Energy Review, and
the Annual Energy Review. In addition, the EIA uses the data for coal supply analyses and in short-term modeling efforts, which produce
forecasts of coal supply and prices requested by Congress. The forecast data also appear in the Short-Term Energy Outlook and the Annual
Energy Outlook.

# This is the small effort from my side to predict the coal production for year 2018 by using last five years data
